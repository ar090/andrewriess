            Hi my name is Andrew. I am a fullstack developer capable of taking a project from start to finish through back end, design &amp content, front end, and deployment. While I prefer working on REST API development and various web application frameworks, I have experience in all stages of the development process. Writing micro services and utilities that improve work flows or automating processes are also right in my wheel house. I am all about understanding the bigger picture and coding to not only solve problems but increase efficiency whenever possible.

        <div class="border-green"></div>
        <p>
            I absolutely love coding. To me it’s the ultimate puzzle. Its constantly evolving nature which leads to a lifetime’s worth of learning keeps everything interesting and everyday different. It’s the most frustrating yet rewarding experience I can imagine. There is only one thing that beats the feeling I get from looking at something I’ve developed. It’s when I see other people using that something. Coding is like a roller coaster of emotions that I would stand in line for over and over again.
            <br>
            <br>      
            When I’m not coding, I tend to still pound the keys for games. I’ve recently been on a huge nostalgia kick which has landed me on a private vanilla WOW server. I’ve also been known to crush N64 and would be lying if I said I’d been beaten before in Mario Tennis. Outside of gaming, I enjoy competitive shooting, anything from trap to 3-gun. Other then that, going to the gym, Spikeball, playing guitar and anything that involves floating on water.

            Fully functional, and currently operational e-commerce store built primarily in Python using Django as a framework. The site follows a traditional drop shipping business plan which requires real-time inventory updates scheduled with Celery and Raw MySQL. Multistage software development lifecycle featuring local dev, staging network with sample data, and versioned production. Deployed with growth in mind utilizing easily scalable AWS databases, services and storage. Some notable integrations on theGunGuy.com include Algolia for their instant search service, and Authorize.net to customize a unique payment system while remaining PCI compliant. From an administrative perspective, the site is completely manageable from a non-technical perspective. Every user action and flow is accessible in an admin dashboard. Things like viewing user and product statistics, and links which execute python scripts to perform useful actions like charge a credit card were integrated as well.

            This is a nifty data compilation, and normalization API that I built and ultimately stuck a front end on. Gunavail takes data from several distributors in any way possible (XML, CSV, TXT, scraping, yes even SOAP) to ultimately be normalized and combined into a master MySQL database for real-time inventory representation. This database is connected to a Flask API which feeds search results, data and other useful information about updates to customers. Celery is used to schedule all the tasks which update catalog information on 15 minute and weekly intervals.

            Hubsy was built as a submission for Amazon's Chatbot Challenge 2017 seeking to redefine the away users traditionally manage their HubSpot account. For Hubsy’s conversational interface and to execute complex commands within the HubSpot API, AWS – Lex was used in sync with AWS – Lambda. Users flow through conversation while variables are stored within Lex and transmitted to the HubSpot API via Lambda functions written in Node.js. Hubsy’s infrastructure was all managed via terraform and he is deployed on Facebook, Slack and AWS Alexa.
