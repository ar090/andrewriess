            Hi, my name is Andrew. I am an entrepreneur and fullstack developer capable of taking a project from start to finish through back-end, design &amp content, front-end, and deployment. While I prefer working on REST API’s and various web application frameworks, I have experience in all stages of the development process. Writing micro services and utilities that improve work flows or automate processes also fit right in my wheel house. I am all about understanding the bigger picture and coding to not only solve problems but increase efficiency whenever possible. As a quick and determined learner I really enjoy tackling new challenges albeit languages, services, or frameworks.

            Imagine something that’s so frustrating yet so rewarding you just can’t stay away. To me, that’s coding and I absolutely love it. It’s like working on the ultimate puzzle only better because you don’t have to worry about missing pieces and you can create or resize them as you please. The constantly evolving nature of programming keeps everyday unique. No matter how much time I spend on something, there is always more to learn. The only feeling that’s better than seeing something you have developed come to life, is seeing other people actually use that something.
            <br>

            If I’m not coding, I tend to still pound the keys for games. I’ve recently been on a huge nostalgia kick which has landed me on a private vanilla WoW server. I’ve also been known to crush N64 and would be lying if I said I’d been beaten before in Mario Tennis. Outside of gaming, I enjoy competitive shooting, anything from trap to 3-gun. Other than that, going to the gym, Spikeball, playing guitar and pretty much anything that involves floating on water.

            Fully functional, and currently operational e-commerce store built primarily in Python’s Django framework. The site follows a traditional drop shipping business model which requires real-time inventory updates scripted together with Python, MySQL and scheduled with Celery. I use a complete multistage software development lifecycle featuring local dev, a staging server with sample data, and versioned production. It was deployed with growth in mind and features easily scalable AWS databases, services and storage. Some notable integrations on theGunGuy.com include Algolia for an instant search service, and Authorize.net to customize a unique payment process while remaining PCI compliant. From an administrative perspective, the site is completely manageable from a non-technical perspective. Every user action and flow is accessible in an admin dashboard. Several Python functions address all kinds of routine management duties. Things like viewing user and product statistics, charging credit cards, updating product or dealer info, and syncing data with 3rd party integrations are all easily accessible through the admin portal.

            This started as a nifty data compilation, and normalization API that I built primarily for a local business to improve an internal process. I ultimately ended up sticking a quick JavaScript/JQuery front end on it so that the database could be easily searched outside of just the API. Gunavail takes data from several distributors in any way possible (XML, CSV, TXT, scraping, and yes even SOAP) to ultimately be normalized and combined into a master MySQL database for real-time inventory representation. This database is connected to a Flask API which feeds search results, data and other useful information about updates to customers. Celery is used to schedule all of the micro services that update catalog information continuously on 15 minute and weekly intervals. Gunavail was written with a ton of raw MySQL and Python to efficiently tear through hundreds of thousands of records on a routine basis. The tool is hosted in AWS and delivers content regularly to other dependent projects.

            Hubsy was built as a submission for Amazon's Chatbot Challenge 2017 seeking to redefine the way users traditionally manage their HubSpot account. For Hubsy’s conversational interface and to execute complex commands within the HubSpot API, AWS – Lex was used in sync with AWS – Lambda. Users flow through conversation while variables are stored within Lex and transmitted to the HubSpot API via Lambda functions written in Node.js. Hubsy’s infrastructure was all managed via terraform and he is deployed on Facebook, Slack and AWS Alexa.
